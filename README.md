# Interactive Fiction Project(s)

Reviving the interactive fiction project I accidentally deleted. I am 
deciding which programming language or game engine I will be using.

You are reading the story of the missing person through logs (from
each character) and character profiles.

The player searches and sorts through a database of text files of the
main character, her missing friend, and profiles written by her.

The search query only give five documents.

Documents such as profiles, and logs from each character. 

This game is inspired from Sam Barlow's HER STORY along with its
playthroughs.
